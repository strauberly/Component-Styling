In this project we go over
ways to stylize components dynamically with React as well as scoping them.

This is a simple demo application.

Implemented styled component package into the project for styling components in a coped manner but ultimately I agree with the instructor that rather than styling in the js file I would prefer a level of separation by keeping the css file separate and making use of css modules.

I appreciate what the package does and how it organizes the code but I also support minimalism in package dependencies.

Mostly just appreciated the discussion on dynamic styling.

This concludes this project for this topic, though my understanding is we utilize a version of it for the next discussion on debugging a react application.

Thanks for checking it out!
